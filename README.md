# SPH
Set Partitioning Heuristic (SPH) based on CPLEX MILP solver and created starting from the CFT [1] Heuristic implemented by Accorsi Luca and Cavaliere Francesco (available soon).

## Build
1. Create a target binary target directory:

        [sph]$ mkdir build
        

2. Create Makefile using Cmake

        [sph]$ cd build
        [build]$ cmake ..
    
    The current build options are available:

        [build]$ cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Release|Debug]] # Build type
        [build]$ cmake .. [-DENABLE_VERBOSE=[ON|OFF]]  # Switch on/off prints

3. Build the binary and the single-header with make

        [build]$ make -j
        
The binary will be placed inside the chosen directory.
The merged header file containing all the project will be placed in "`sph/one_header_only/SPH.hpp`".

## Use as library
To use the algorithm in other C++ project, just include generated header (`SPH.hpp`) in your project.

The SPHeuristic class can be used as high-level interface to the algorithm.
